# Image_Generator
The Image_Generator is created using the concept of Deep Convolutional GANs. The Generator is created using Transpose Convolution layers and it is the one crearting the images. The second part is the Discriminator created using Convolutional layers which discriminates the images as real or fake and feeds the output to the generator to make it better every epoch
